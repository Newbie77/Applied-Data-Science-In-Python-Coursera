# Applied-Data-Science-In-Python-Coursera

This project is the weekly demos and assignments from the corresponding Coursera course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)

Brief Description:

The 5 courses in this University of Michigan specialization introduce learners to data science through the python programming language. This skills-based specialization is intended for learners who have a basic python or programming background, and want to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight into their data.
